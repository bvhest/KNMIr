Title: R Wrapper-Functions for the 'KNMI' (Dutch Meteorological Institute) API
Version: 0.5.0
Authors@R: person("Bart", "van Hest", email = "hestbv@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Functions to retrieve raw and processed climate
    data from the official Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI). For some stations data goes back to 1900. Two functions 
    are provied to retrieve the 6-day weather forecast from the KNMI and the 14-day forecast from the Weerplaza-website.
    With helper-functions, the data can be subsetted based on year and specified variables. The returned
    data is converted to SI-units, when necessary. Several additional helper functions
    are available, such as a function that calculates the Huglin- or VE-index.
    The package also contains two KNMI datasets; one with all land- and sea-based measurement stations and one with 
    long term averages from 2000-2015.
